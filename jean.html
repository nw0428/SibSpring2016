                                In a heartbeat after I learned how to write code that made
                                the computer add two numbers, I became passionate about
                                programming. Later that same year I was selected among a pool
                                of competitive students for a scholarship to study
                                Computer Science. When I started, the first thing
                                I noticed was the variety of technologies that
                                I was being exposed to. They were all exciting and
                                I wanted to try them all. I did graduate with Bachelor
                                degree in Computer Science and started working full time
                                for Habitat for Humanity. After the 2010 earthquake in Haiti,
                                my skills to support technology infrastructures were
                                more needed than programming. Therefore, I decided to work
                                on side projects and later launched an app (http://www.branchew.com)
                                written in the PHP framework Yii that connects Haitian professionals.

                                I moved to Boston soon after that and wanted to also try
                                Engineering as part of my new start.
                                I recently went to Harvard to do research on soft robotics.
                                I was successful on finding new processes to create
                                soft actuators with significant results that will soon be published.
                                I realized that I was missing programming.
                                My past experience and passion for the web led me to find
                                Startup Institute where Iâ€™m working to further my skills
                                for a career in the web industry.

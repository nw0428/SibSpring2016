				<div id="aboutBodyView" class="subViewBodyView">
					<p class="subViewBodyText">My start in graphic design and web development began with film at the age of 12, when I purchased my first camcorder. In order to make the title designs I wanted, I had to create them myself, and the only option was to teach myself basic graphic design.</p>

					<p class="subViewBodyText">From there my interest in art and design only grew, and in the Fall of 2013, I began to delve into computer science and software development. I had finished developing (in Adobe Illustrator) the rough draft of the interface for an app idea that I had been pondering for some time, and I found myself at a dead end. With no prior knowledge of computer science, I had two choices: find a programmer who shared my passion and vision for the product who would be willing to sacrifice months to develop the app (for free), or teach myself to program and build it myself.</p>

					<p class="subViewBodyText">I chose the latter and have spent the past two and a half years learning new programing languages, computer science concepts and theory, as well as developing my own apps and web pages (like the one you are viewing right now).</p>

					<p class="subViewBodyText">The end result was not only a completed mobile application for iOS of which I am tremendously proud, but I have also discovered a new passion for web development. Through this process, I found that programming tapped into both sides of my personality—my creative side and my logical-thinking side—making it a natural fit for me, as well as something that genuinely sparks my passion.</p>

					<p class="subViewBodyText">From what I've found, programming is a craft, which requires constant perfecting. Developers are athletes who always look to find new and better ways of building applications. The same enthusiasm for the craft that motivated me to build a complex mobile application from scratch continues to motivate me to improve as a developer.</p>
